## Under which conditions should HEDIS quality measure be used for Pay for Performance?

### Assumptions
Throughout this analysis we assume valid measures: quality measures are unbiased estimates of true underlying performance, and this measures cannot be manipulated. Cite all work that focused on this assumption. 

### Benefits
 - $B_{1}$: Encourage good practices: increase health ($\Delta^{+}$ QALYs)
 - $B_{2}$: Reduces waste. 

### Costs
 - $C_{1}$: Implementation costs
 - $C_{2}$: Misclassification costs:
    - Naive approach.
    - Misclassification error attenuates incentives (Rothstein)
    - Measurement error *affects* optimal level quality (Mullen). 

### Policy Equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
W &= \sum_{i  = 1 }^{N} w^{b}_{i} E[B_{i}] - \sum_{j  = 1 }^{M} w^{c}_{j} E[C_{j}]\\
E[B_{1}] &= f_{1}(\beta_{1})\\
\dots \\
E[B_{N}] &= f_{N}(\beta_{N})\\
E[C_{1}] &= g_{1}(\gamma_{1})\\
\dots \\
E[C_{N}] &= g_{M}(\gamma_{M})
\end{aligned}
$$

### Toy Example

#### Benefits
 - $B_{1}$: Establishing a P4P based on quality measures increases $H$ QALYs per dollar paid in bonuses. Each QALY is valued at $P$ dollars.
$$
\begin{aligned}
E[B_{1}] &= H \times P
\end{aligned}
$$
 - $B_{2}$: P4P based on quality measures reduces waste in a fraction $\alpha$ of the costs without P4P $C^{0}$:   
$$
\begin{aligned}
E[B_{2}] &= \alpha C^{0}
\end{aligned}
$$


### Costs
 - $C_{1}$: Implementation (measuring and recording quality measures, and deploying P4P) will have a overall costs fixed costs of $FC$
$$
\begin{aligned}
E[C_{1}] &= FC
\end{aligned}
$$

 - $C_{2}$: Misclassification costs each dollar that was assign to physicians that did not "deserve" it, will be consider as wasteful. The average fraction of misclasified resources is $m$. 
$$
\begin{aligned}
E[C_{2}] &= m(H \times P + \alpha C^{0})
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally policy makers may choose to weigh costs and benefits differently, depending on components outside the reach of the evidence gathered here. This different valuations are captured in the weights $w^{b}_{\cdot}, w^{c}_{\cdot}$ set by default to 1. The only requirement is that such values should be recorded and tracked as part of the overall decision of any stakeholder. 

We propose that this framework should be used to include

## Methodological inovations:
 - Make explicit all the components in the policy decision model.
 - Set up the decision model in a open source format and keep track of all changes. 
 - Allow for all the parameters to be modifiable within their range. 
 - Propose that each decision has to be tied to a set of known parameters. 

Later versions of this framework should link each slider with a drop down menu for the relevant literature.
